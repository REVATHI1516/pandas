An abstract method is a method that is declared, but contains no implementation. Abstract classes may not be instantiated, and its abstract methods must be implemented by its subclasses.\n",
    "        By defining an abstract base class, you can define a common Application Program Interface(API) for a set of subclasses. This capability is especially useful in situations where a third-party is going to provide implementations, such as with plugins, but can also help you when working in a large team or with a large code-base where keeping all classes in your mind is difficult or not possible. \n",

    "    Decorators are a very powerful and useful tool in Python since it allows programmers to modify the behaviour of function or class. Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to extend the behaviour of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it.In Decorators, functions are taken as the argument into another function and then called inside the wrapper function.A few good examples are when you want to add logging, test performance, perform caching, verify permissions, and so on.You can also use one when you need to run the same code on multiple functions. This avoids you writing duplicating code."
